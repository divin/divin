# Hi. I'm Divin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Data Scientist** with a **background in Physics** who loves **coding** and digging into **complex data** to find **cool insights**.

When I'm not **crunching numbers**, **training machine learning models**, or **building data pipelines**, you'll probably find me diving into some **creative projects**. I dabble in **music**, **drawing**, **app**, and **game development**. The last one is a perfect mix of all my interests.

Feel free to browse my repositories and contact me if you have any questions.
